# Captain of Industries Data Export Tool

This is a tool used to export data in Captain of Industries (the game).

## How to use

Download the archive, and put all the files under `%appdata%\Captain of Industry\Mods\COIDataExport`. After a new game is created, there will be four output JSON files under the `COIDataExport` folder.

## Note

This tool is intended to replace David Melo's [captain-of-data](https://github.com/David-Melo/captain-of-data) mod as he is not updating the tool. Any help with the development is welcome.

This tool removed most of the hard-coded IDs and names in David's tool, makes it more reliable and resistance across version changes.
